Welcome to the networking-enabled EC535 Stock Image v1.0!

This stock package includes many additional tools and utilities
compared to the ones you've used previously. 

You may use this stock image for assignments where configuring
the kernel, the rootfs, and/or busybox are NOT part of the main
goals. If you have any questions, please contact your
instructor or TA.

Have fun!
